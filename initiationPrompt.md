# Initiation Prompt

Use this workflow at the start of each implementation cycle:

1. Read `currentProgress.md` and `mvp.md`.
2. Build the next section.
3. Test the section and make logic updates as needed until tests succeed.
4. Update `currentProgress.md`.
5. Commit work.

Execution notes:
- Keep changes scoped to one small section at a time.
- Do not skip testing before updating `currentProgress.md` and committing.
- Record key decisions and test outcomes in `currentProgress.md`.
